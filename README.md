A simple hack to generate a circular sliderule 


### Welcome
Feel free to browse the source. You can run the .jar file to create the slide rule in [.svg](https://github.com/DustinCSWagner/sliderule/blob/master/slideRuler.svg?raw=true) and [.pdf](https://github.com/DustinCSWagner/sliderule/blob/master/slideRuler.pdf?raw=true), or just download them from the root of the project directory. This project uses Batik for rendering. Its uploaded as an eclipse project. 


### Execute the jar
```
$ java -jar sliderule.jar
```


Thanks for looking.
